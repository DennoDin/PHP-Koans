PHP-Koans
=========

PHP programming exercises. Designed as a series of code blocks that must be fixed for tests to pass. Designed to teach the basics of PHP and inspired by the absolutely awesome http://www.rubykoans.com

Run ```php koans.php``` from a terminal and follow the instructions.

The framework for the tests is there and I'm still working through building out all of the actual coding exercises.
