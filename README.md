PHP-Koans
=========

Learn PHP by fixing failing tests. Designed as a series of successive problems where you type missing pieces of code to learn the basics all the way to advanced concepts. When you're finished you'll also have an entire library of code samples to reference as well.

Designed to teach the basics of PHP and inspired by the absolutely awesome http://www.rubykoans.com Requires PHP 5.3 or greater.

#Prerequisites
* Install PHP 5.3 or higher and the ability to run the ```php``` command from the command line.
* Install Composer from https://getcomposer.org

# Getting Started
1. Checkout or fork this repository and make sure you're on the master branch.
2. Open up a terminal run ```composer install``` from the checked out project to install dependencies.
3. Run ```php koans.php``` from a terminal and follow the instructions.

#Status
I'm building this out as a side project when I have time, but everything in the master branch will always be complete. If you get stuck you can also check the solutions branch to see the pieces of missing code to fix the problems.
