PHP-Koans
=========

Learn PHP by fixing failing tests. Designed as a series of successive problems where you type missing pieces of code to learn the basics all the way to advanced concepts. When you're finished you'll also have an entire library of code samples to reference as well.

Designed to teach the basics of PHP and inspired by the absolutely awesome http://www.rubykoans.com Requires PHP 5.3 or greater.

#Prerequisites
* Install PHP 5.3 or higher and the ability to run the ```php``` from the command line.
* Install Composer from https://getcomposer.org

# Getting Started
1. Checkout or fork this repository.
2. Open up a terminal run ```composer install``` from the checked out project.
3. Run ```php koans.php``` from a terminal and follow the instructions.

#Status
The framework for the tests is there and I'm still working through building out all of the actual coding exercises. Let me know if you found it useful.
